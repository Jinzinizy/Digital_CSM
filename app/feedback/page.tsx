      <p>Great takehome assignment, I thouroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot in the process- the difficulty was just about right considering I haven't done any Git/front-end work since University. <br/>
     <br/>The only feedback I would give is that this exercise requires a user to already have insalled their own Terminal, Editor etc... which not every candidate may have on their home setup - consider mentioning this in "Getting Setup".</p>
    </div>
