- <span style="color: lightyellow;">Background</span> - I am a CISO for a firm that just signed on for Enterprise with Vercel Secure Compute. I am looking forward to meeting you for an onboarding session to talk about the security products Vercel offers as well as go over the state of our customer journey.
- <span style="color: lightyellow;">Question</span> - What resources would you want to prepare to make sure that the CISO has everything they need to succeed as they migrate to the Enterprise version of the platform? Feel free to use documentation from vercel.com, and our YouTube channel to find assets to help.

Hi Customer,<br/><br/>
Thank you for reaching out and let me be the first to extend a warm welcome. As an enterprise customer, you can enjoy enhanced benefits such as a dedicated account manager, <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[upgraded SLAs](https://vercel.com/legal/sla) </span> and <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[response times](https://vercel.com/legal/support-terms#when),</span> so be sure to take advantage of this. <br/>
I look forward to discussing our offerings with <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[Vercel Secure Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute) </span> and addressing any questions you may have regarding the <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[enterprise cohort](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/enterprise#vercel-enterprise-plan).</span> Please visit this <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[short blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-security) </span> to familiarise yourself with the product before our scheduled time to talk.
