A customer is just getting started with Vercel and has questions about recommended options for third-party integrations for Monitoring or Logging. How would you respond to the customer?
<br/><br/>
# **Answer:** 
Thank you for reaching out! While Vercel provides robust tools for monitoring and analyzing your applications, it only stores log for 3 days by default. For greater control and detailed logging, we recommend taking advantage of our Log Drains. Log drains allow you to debug, monitor, and analyze logs from your applications by forwarding them to a 3rd party service for persisted storage, larger data volumes and more detailed logging. Visit this documentation <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[link](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains/configure-log-drains) </span> get started -  also see some of our, but not limited to, 3rd party solutions you can currently integrate with;
