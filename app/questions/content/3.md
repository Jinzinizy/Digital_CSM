Hi Customer,<br/>
Thanks for reaching out! I’d be happy to answer some of your questions regarding redirects. The first thing you should be aware of is the type of redirect your application should implement, whether it be a <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[Static vs Dynamic and/or you need a Permanent vs Temporary](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#redirects) </span> redirect - check the link if you are unsure. Once, you’ve understood this you'll likely want to apply it using some best practices. Here are a few that we suggest; 
<br/><br/>
<center> 
	1. Make use of Vercel by utilizing its inbuilt features
    	<span style="color: steelblue;"><code>next.config.js</code>:</span> - You can take advantage of Vercel’s built-in redirects feature in the `next.config.js` file, which is particularly useful for redirects that are specific to your Next.js application.
    	<span style="color: steelblue;"><code>vercel.json</code>:</span> - Vercel allows you to define redirects in a `vercel.json` file at the root of your project. This is often the most flexible and maintainable way to manage redirects, especially for projects with many redirect rules.<br/><br/>
	2. Avoid long redirect chains - Try to direct the response directly to the final destination wherever possible. Remember destinations should reach an HTTPS domain. This ensures security and avoids mixed content warnings, one of the beauties of being on the cloud. :)<br/><br/>
	3. …and finally, test your configuration - With Vercel, you can use a preview deployment to test redirects before deploying them to production, one of the beauties of being on Vercel. ;)
