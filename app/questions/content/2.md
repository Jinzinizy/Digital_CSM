Hi Customer,

Thanks for reaching out! So you don’t know when to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions and/or Edge Middleware? Not to worry, these server-side functions play a crucial role in how your web app will communicate its instructions to one another. What’s important to understand is which of these functions, is most applicable to your scenario and how each is optimised for a specific purpose. In fact, you can combine a combination of the 3 to create powerful logic to process your requests.  Let’s dive deeper; <br/><br/>

- <ul> <span style="color: steelblue;">Edge Functions </span> - Quick, localised requests As its name suggests these functions run at the edge, meaning they are executed closer to the user and offer extremely low-latency responses, typically measured in milliseconds. They are perfect for localized content such as; Location, Device type etc. Think back to the time when you could not access that Netflix series due to it not being available in your region - an Edge function is likely being utilized here! </ul> 
- <ul> <span style="color: steelblue;">Serverless Functions </span> - The all-rounder These are designed for intensive, resource-heavy processes like processing large files - a very typical example of when serverless functions are used or even querying/interacting with large databases. Why? they scale automatically, these functions will create more instances as needed and you only pay for the resources you actually use. Serverless Functions are the all-rounder, they are so well-rounded, that they form the foundations and backbone of many cloud-first vendors today - Tray.AI for example.</ul>

- <ul><span style="color: steelblue;">Edge Middleware </span> - Intercepting and modifying requests
This function allows you to run a piece of code before the request is completed - a powerful tool to customise how, where, what and when you would like the request to look like. One thing of note here is that these functions do NOT return the request, instead, they perform an action on the request such as transforming or validation. As such, a popular use case for these functions is to block unwanted requests determined by criteria. For example, an Edge Middleware could be used to protect against unwanted traffic based on its IP, Header values, or other identifiers.<ul/><br/>
- <ul><span style="color: lightyellow;">In Conclusion </span> - Understanding what your needs are is the first step, Do you have a lightweight request that needs a quick response? Use Edge functions. Want to redirect requests or perform a check? Use the Edge Middleware. Talking to an API or unsure of what your request is? Go with a Serverless function. Remember, all three of these functions are serverless, there is no set-up and management required. Vercel takes care of everything for you which is extremely powerful for scaling your modern-day web apps.</ul> <br/><br/>

Hopefully, this has given you more insight to when you should be using these functions but please feel free to reply in the thread if you have any further questions; happy to help!
