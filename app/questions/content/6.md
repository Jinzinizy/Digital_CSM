Hi Customer,

Thank you for reaching out! There are a few ways we could tackle this but first, letâ€™s check your account for any unusual activity, you can do so by visiting your <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[Usage Page](https://vercel.com/mujins-projects/~/usage) </span> in your dashboard. We have great <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/networking) </span>  on this very subject that I suggest taking a look at first. Should you find everything working as normal, then we can focus on optimizing some requests to reduce the load of your usages. You can implement these popular strategies depending on which is the most applicable to your solution - let's take a look at 2 common examples;<br/><br/>
# <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization#image-optimization-with-vercel) </span> - Use Next.js's built-in next/image component to serve optimized images. This reduces the image size and thus lowers data transfer costs. The image component serves WebP formats, lazy-loads images, and serves different resolutions based on the user's device.
# <span style="color: deepskyblue;">[Caching and Network Usage](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#caching-on-vercel's-edge-network) </span> - Leverage caching by ensuring your static assets and API responses are cached at Vercel's Edge Network. This reduces the number of times data is fetched from the origin server, cutting down on origin transfer costs. You can configure caching in your Next.js project through headers in the next.config.js file. Using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) can also help by allowing you to update static content without rebuilding your entire site - in turn reducing the total load on your server. <br/><br/>
